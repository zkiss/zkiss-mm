I had never done or had mentionable knowledge of DDD before joining [FOODit](foodit).
We are currently in the process of breaking up a ‘[Big Ball of Mud](bbm)’ into smaller bits
(some might even say microservices) to make the code more extensible, readable and maintainable.
In the process of doing so we are trying hard to apply Domain Driven Design principles.
