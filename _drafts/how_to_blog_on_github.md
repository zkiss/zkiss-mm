Starting a blog or a simple personal site is easy.
There are many services with a free tier that allow hosting static websites:
[Netlify][net], [GitLab Pages][gl], and of course [GitHub Pages][gh]. 
I have picked GitHub Pages, since I am already a GitHub user.

[net]: https://www.netlify.com/
[gl]: https://pages.gitlab.io
[gh]: https://pages.github.com/


Simple guide
https://pages.github.com/

Too simple.
Steps after with jekyll:

1) select theme
2) themes have their own getting started guides, and conventions, using minimal.
3) index: list blog posts
4) create first post

Most themes hide this issue, but to posts directly from other posts might be affected.
