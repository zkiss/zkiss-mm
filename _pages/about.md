I am a software engineer since 2007.
I have worked at various startups and a few larger organisations in different domains.
 
I have a passion for understanding the problem space I'm working in and
coming up with the best (most robust or scalable) engineering solution I can think of.

Often this proves impractical to implement;

- The inefficiencies the solution addresses do not manifest in practice.
    This is frequently because of lower volumes on production in the foreseeable
    future, than what would be required to make them noticeable to anyone.
- The idea comes too late, making it more expensive to change the system.
    The imperfections are not (yet) worth the effort to fix them. 
- There are other tasks in the backlog, which are more important to deliver.

These things bug me.
I will write about some of them here.
By doing so, I am hoping to distill my thoughts on these subjects.
I am also hoping to produce sufficiently good arguments,
that I can use in the future when I encounter similar issues again.
