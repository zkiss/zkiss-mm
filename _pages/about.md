I am a software developer since 2007.
I have worked at various startups and a few larger organisations in different domains.
 
I have a passion for understanding the problem space I'm working in and
delivering the best engineering solution I can think of.

In reality, often times this is impractical to do because of time constraints and simple economics;
the imperfections are not worth the effort to fix them.
Other times it is not the amount of effort required what is too big, but there are other tasks
on the backlog, that are more important to deliver.

These things bug me.
I will write about some of it here in the hopes that it proves useful for someone else.
